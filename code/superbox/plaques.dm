After a brief bomb scare in which the CentCom representative was assassinated \
by the Syndicate, the crew was sent on a dangerous mission to an unexplored \
distant location, where they uncovered a depowered space station filled with \
roving monsters and the corspes of friend and foe alike. Despite several close \
calls with the monsters, a fire in the toxins storage, and rolling a 2 on the \
Die of Fate, the crew ultimately managed to recapture the lost outpost for \
Nanotrasen and return, for the most part, safe.
